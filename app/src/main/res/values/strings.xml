    <string name="fragment_animation_description">This will override the default transaction animation, which means that all the upcoming transaction animations will be the selected one, unless you change it again.

    <string name="fragment_switch_description">Switch will replace the current fragment by a new fragment. This will destroy the fragment and clears it from memory. This is a good approach if your fragments save heavy data. Note that when you navigate back to the fragment, all of it\'s states are restored</string>
    <string name="fragment_navigate_description">Navigate will attach a new fragment on top of the current fragment. This will keep the previous fragment alive and won\'t destroy it. This is a good approach for fragments with light data</string>
    <string name="fragment_restart_description">Restart will clear the back-stack and replace the current fragment by a new one. This means that the previously attached fragments won\'t be accessible if you navigate back and will be completely destroyed and cleared from memory. This is a good approach for single-launch screens such as login, registration, welcomeâ€¦ etc</string>
